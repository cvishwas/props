ETF Connect Project: New SAS Product Development
- Development of a new SAS product, ETF Connect, for client UNB.
- Project involves creating a separate instance of existing ETF applications, excluding BBH shared services components.
- Focus is on building roles and entitlements as a self-service component for UNB's access to basket creation, order taking, and order settlement applications.

Role and Permission Structure for ETF Connect
- New application will utilize role groups and user groups to manage permissions.
- Features include user group selection, permission association, and a superuser export functionality for compliance.
- Discussions focus on best practices for role design, including least privilege access and toxic combinations to prevent conflicts of interest.

User Experience and Compliance Considerations
- Emphasis on clear, business-friendly language in role descriptions for user understanding and reduced security risks.
- Importance of collaboration with business users to review and optimize existing roles before mirroring them in the new product.
- Discussions include compliance requirements, annual attestations, and the need for user-friendly reports for access control.

Authentication and Entitlement Management
- UNB's admin users will manage user authentication and entitlements.
- Two-layer authentication process: UNB platform validation followed by BBH authorization.
- ETF Admin will manage entitlements within the BBH system, providing UNB with selectable options for user assignment.
