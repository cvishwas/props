Certainly! Here's a polished and more structured version of your self-appraisal for the first half of the year:

Self-Appraisal: First Half of the Year

I continued my role as a Scrum Master at the beginning of this year, effectively facilitating Agile processes and ensuring smooth sprint execution. During this period, I shifted my focus to [B], taking on new responsibilities and contributing to project objectives.

Additionally, I took on the design and development of Entitlements, working extensively to understand the existing C Entitlements, which served as the foundation for the new design. Based on this understanding, I devised a comprehensive new design for the Entitlements system.

I presented the proposed design to fellow architects, business stakeholders, and upper management to secure necessary approvals. Once the architecture was approved, I collaborated closely with the database team to design the corresponding table structures, ensuring alignment with the overall system architecture.

Furthermore, I contributed to the development of services related to Entitlements, preparing them for implementation. Throughout this process, I maintained a focus on delivering scalable, efficient solutions that meet business needs.
