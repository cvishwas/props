Yes, you can use the session ID to authenticate a user across different microservices during the lifetime of the session. This approach is common in microservices architectures, and there are a few considerations and best practices to keep in mind:

1. Session Management:
   Centralized Session Store: Use a centralized session store (like Redis, Memcached, or a database) to manage session data. This allows all microservices to access session information consistently.
   Session ID: When the user logs in, generate a unique session ID and store it along with user information in the session store.

2. Authentication Mechanism:
   Pass the session ID in the HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization or a custom header) for all subsequent requests to other microservices. This way, each service can validate the session ID.
   Alternatively, you could use cookies to manage the session ID, but this needs to be configured correctly to handle cross-origin requests if your services are hosted on different domains.

3. Validation:
   Each microservice should validate the session ID by checking it against the centralized session store. If the session is valid and active, the service can then proceed to handle the request.
   Implement expiration policies for sessions to enhance security, ensuring that old sessions can no longer be used after a certain period.

4. Security Considerations:
   Use HTTPS to secure communication between the client and services to prevent session ID interception.
   Consider implementing additional security measures such as token revocation, session expiration, and monitoring for unusual activity.
   Implement CSRF protection if using cookies.

5. Single Sign-On (SSO):
   If your application grows in complexity or you plan to integrate with other applications, consider implementing an SSO mechanism. This allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple services, often using OAuth or OpenID Connect.

6. Microservices Communication:
   If using service-to-service communication, ensure that the service making the request includes the session ID in the request to the downstream service, enabling it to authenticate the user context.

Summary:
Using a session ID for authentication across microservices is a valid approach. Ensure you have a robust session management strategy, validate sessions appropriately, and implement necessary security measures to protect user data and session integrity.
